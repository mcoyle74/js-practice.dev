/*
	Write a function that decomposes a given positive integer's factorial (n!) 
	into its prime factors. Your inputs will be anywhere from 2 -> 20 (due to 
	different language's math limitations). Your output should be an equation 
	string of the prime factors listed from least to greatest.

	Example: 
		input 5									input: 17
		(5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)			output: 2^15 * 3^6 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11 * 13 * 17
		output: 2^3 * 3 * 5
