	Given a string of words, find the highest scoring word. Each letter of the
	word has a score corresponding to its place in the alphabet (a = 1, b = 2, 
	, c = 3, ..., z = 26). If two words have the same score, return the word
	that comes first in the string. All letters will be lowercase, all inputs
	will be valid.
	Example:
		input: 'two toads talking'
